This tester is intended to be used on FT_CONTAINERS, a √âcole 42's project in which students have to reimplement some of the STL containers, based on c++98. This tester is designed to work for the projects as per May 2021's version. Meaning it will not test the new revision and bonuses. But you will be able to test each container individually.
It performs tests to verify the student implementation based on STL behaviour and output comparison.

Tests are performed on: 

- Vector
- Stack
- Map
- List
##### Bonus part :
- Set
- Deque
- Queue

***NB: this test assumes you have implemented your own ft::pair (as you should).***

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

- First, place your projects headers in directory : `./includes/your_headers_files`
- Then update the file `./includes/your_headers.hpp` to include your files.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

- `make` will precompile your headers and check their std98 compliance, then compile the tester.
- `make f` will do all of the above and run every tests.
#### To test only selected containers: 
- `make [container names]` will perform tests on a specific containers, one after the other according to the list passed.
- `make cpp98` will perform tests one your header to verify cpp98 compliance.

- `make compile_<container_name>` will compile the specific container tests.

NB: In case of failure, each test will display errors and run the next test, at the end of each container test unit, a message will show if something went wrong at any point.

#### Special needs:
In order to use the tester with valgrind or fsanitize, some tests need to reduce their memory size. Use `make valgrind_mode=1` To compile the tester with such smaller tests

Please note this test is based on my own work, you should use it as a complement of your own testes. First because it might be wrong on some points, second because you will learn much more by doing your tester than doing the project itself: you will learn how to use the STL's version, its limitations, its power etc. ...
